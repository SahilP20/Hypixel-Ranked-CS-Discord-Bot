# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** Discord API, Java, Maven

This bot was primarily built using Java; however, additional Discord API commands were needed to link user accounts to specific commands. 

# Lessons Learned:
One of the most difficult parts of this project was reading stats and associating them with corresponding Discord usernames. Since the API functions were all new to me, this was quite the challenge. However, after strenuous research, I was able to understand how to fetch and parse data from the API. Along with player feedback, I was able to fix certain issues and even add additonal features such as a captains command.
